✨ Features

📝 Post a Favor
Need help? Post your favor request with a title, description, and location. TaskBridge uses smart geolocation (web or native) to anchor your task in your area — so help is always near.

🔍 Explore Feed
Scroll through a live feed of favor requests in your community. Tasks are marked with statuses like Open, In Progress, and Completed, keeping things transparent and real-time.

🤝 Accept & Complete Favors
Found a task you want to help with? Tap "I'll do it" to accept. If you’re the task owner, you can later mark it as Completed once the help is delivered.

🛡️ Trust Badges
Build reputation through actions.Badges reflect your commitment to helping others.

👤 Personal Profile
View your posted and accepted favors, email, and your live Trust Badge. A clean, gradient-aesthetic layout with animated feedback makes your profile feel dynamic and personalized.

📍 Location-Aware
Uses expo-location and browser geolocation to capture the user’s real-time position — favor requests feel local and relevant.

🔒 Firebase Auth + Firestore
🔐 Firebase Authentication handles login/logout securely.
🔥 Cloud Firestore stores all favor data, updates in real-time, and reflects changes instantly.
